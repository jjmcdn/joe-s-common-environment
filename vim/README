My vim/gvim configuration files, a collection of colours I'm rather fond of for
different purposes, and what I consider my core plugins.

There's an install.sh script here that you may or may not want to use.  It does
what I want it to do, but you may want to just copy this stuff into your own
locations.  And it certainly does *not* do the right thing if you use vim on
Windows.  I do and as with all things Windows-y, I can't make it behave the way
I think it should.  In Windows, use Cream.  It's what I've resorted to.
