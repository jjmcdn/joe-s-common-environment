" :call F()
" This function lets you see all the lines in a file
" that contain a given regular-expression.
"
" The remaining lines are folded with the manual method,
" and can be opened to see some 'nearby' line.
" 
" If no regular expression is specified, the last regular expression
" speicified for search is utilized.
"
" The idea comes from the mainframe ISPF editor.
"
" zo   to open a fold a bit
" zozj to open a fold a bit and leave the cursor on the fold line
" zO   to open a fold completely 
" zE   to open all folds
"
" zf{motion} to close folders 'a bit more' (or to create folders)
" If you have 2 adjacent folders, zf<ENTER> will 'merge' them.
" In the same way a visible line can be 'added' to a nearby folder.
"
" :call FA()
" This function is similar to F() above, except instead of typing in
" a regular expression, the current word the cursor is over is used as
" the regular expression.
"
" The function FA() has been prepared and added by:
" Ken Huisman - ken.huisman@gmail.com
"
" Suggested mappings:
" :map <F5> :call F()<CR>
" :map <F6> :normal zozj<CR>
" :set backspace=indent,eol,start
" the above setting allows you to go back/forward with "w","b" etc.
" thus opening "a bit" a nearby folder
"
" :map <F1> :call FA()<CR>
" :map <F2> zR
" useful for finding all instances of the current word quickly and then
" opening all the folds when you are done.
" 
" :<Up> to recall the macro after having executed it once
" giving <Up> as an argument, last searches can be repeated/modified
"
" try giving as an expression  nfold
" try giving as an expression  as
" try giving as an expression   as     [that is: ' as' ]
" try giving as an expression  let
" try giving as an expression  ^":
" try giving as an expression  :fun\|:endf
