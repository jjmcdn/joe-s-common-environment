There's nothing in here.  Really, nothing.  Just a bunch of floor sweepings.  I
have scripts littered *everywhere* on my disks.  Or code fragments.  Filthy
little one-offs that may not even be complete.  This is the eqivalent of a
collection of post-it notes on my desk.  Only in directory form, so somewhat
more searchable.  I'm only creating this part so I can clean up the rest of my
disk a bit and hopefully find stuff in here again rather than (poorly)
re-implementing the same thing a half-dozen times.
