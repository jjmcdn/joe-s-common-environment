My screenrc files don't get updated very often, but I see enough people using
ones that are slightly out of date versions of my own that I figure someone will
find these useful.  Maybe even draw my attention to stuff I haven't seen before.

Like my other scripts, as long as you don't care about what you already have in
your dotfiles, a command like this will handle installation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
for i in *
do
   if [[ $i != "README" && $i != "TODO" ]]
   then
      if [ -f $i ]
      then
         cp -b $i ${HOME}/.$i
      fi
   fi
done
------------------------------------------------------------------------
