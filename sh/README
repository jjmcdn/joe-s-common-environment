I intended the fns.* files to be reasonably independent of the rc and profile
files, so you shouldn't need to use my precise configuration in order to use the
functions.  If you do and you find a problem, let me know.

If you don't care about your old configuration files (which is typically me when
I first log in to a new system) you can install these with this command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
for i in *
do
   if [[ $i != "README" && $i != "TODO" ]]
   then
      if [ -f $i ]
      then
         cp -b $i ${HOME}/.$i
      fi
   fi
done
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've also found it to be occasionally useful to create a redistributable tarball
of this stuff.  This works reasonably well for that:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir /tmp/$$
for i in *
do
   if [[ $i != "README" && $i != "TODO" ]]
   then
      if [ -f $i ]
      then
         cp -b $i /tmp/$$/.$i
      fi
   fi
done
cd /tmp/$$
tar zcvf ${HOME}/env-sh.tar.gz .*
cd -
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be aware that https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS is a submodule now, so if
you want to have better ls color selections, you'll also want to take LS_COLORS
from that project and dump it in your home directory as .dircolors.  The rest of
the environment stuff here will know what to do with it.  Something like this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
if [ -f ls_colors/LS_COLORS ]
then
   cp -i ls_colors/LS_COLORS ${HOME}/.dircolors
fi
------------------------------------------------------------------------
