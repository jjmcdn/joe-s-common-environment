The 'everything else' bin.  Mostly dotfiles that don't warrant their own
configuration directory, probably won't be installed wholesale and probably
aren't useful to most people.  My vimperatorrc configuration is the textbook
example, I want it everywhere because I use vimperator everywhere, but odds are
nobody else wants my specific configuration.

The dput.cf in this directory is ONLY useful for talking to a PPA hosted
by Canonical / launchpad.net.  If that's all you're interested in, the
install script here will probably work just fine for you.  If you aren't
interested in using launchpad.net, you don't want this.
