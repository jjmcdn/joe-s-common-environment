The 'everything else' bin.  Mostly dotfiles that don't warrant their own
configuration directory, probably won't be installed wholesale and probably
aren't useful to most people.  My vimperatorrc configuration is the textbook
example, I want it everywhere because I use vimperator everywhere, but odds are
nobody else wants my specific configuration.

Like my other scripts, as long as you don't care about what you already have in
your dotfiles, a command like this will handle installation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
for i in *
do
   if [[ $i != "README" && $i != "TODO" ]]
   then
      if [ -f $i ]
      then
         cp -b $i ${HOME}/.$i
      fi
   fi
done
------------------------------------------------------------------------
