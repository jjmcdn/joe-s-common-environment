All of my configs for Crunchbang.  At the time of this writing it is Waldorf
(CB11) with OpenBox, Conky, Tint2, nitrogen (for managing wallpapers) etc.  Look
around, you'll find lots of stuff in here.  Probably the best thing to do with
this is manually merge these with whatever you're using because you almost
certainly don't want to use my configs as-is.
