# yellow: And if some yahoo is talking about CGL and didn't email me, I
# want to know about it.  You probably don't, though, so these are commented
# out.  These rules search the bodies (~b) so don't pattern any of your own
# rules off them unless you're really willing to pay the price of having mutt
# download and search all of the bodies of all of the mail in the current
# mailbox.  This is probably more cost than you're willing to bear, instead I
# suggest fiddling around with imapfilter.  It's the approach I've chosen.
