Configuration files and support tools for the Mutt email client.

muttrc/
   - contains template mutt configuration files and an install script that is
     intended to be non-destructive, if you happen to already have some existing
     mutt configuration lying around.  It tries to be smart and ask you for
     whatever it will need in order to run.

ldap/
   - not specifically tied to mutt, but I found it when I was looking for a
     script I could plug in to mutt's address book lookup function (bound to
     CTRL-T if you use my muttrc) that would let me search LDAP for email
     addresses and mailing list addresses inside WR.

imapfilter/
   - in no way tied to mutt, a friend suggested I check it out when I complained
     that I missed the server-side filtering features that Evolution (and
     apparently Outlook) did for me.  I'm still learning how to use this tool
     and it's very powerful so be warned, here be dragons.  I've learnt a
     healthy fear of relying too heavily on poorly-understood technology over
     the years, so I'm warning you now, my scripts for imapfilter will likely be
     forever in 'alpha'.
