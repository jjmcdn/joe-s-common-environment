===========================[ W A R N I N G ]============================
 If you are using (or are planning to use) my mutt configuration (most
   likely found in ../muttrc), you'll be much better off letting the
install script there install mutt_ldap_query.pl and .mutt_ldap_query.rc
                           files on it's own.
========================================================================


A perl script that performs LDAP lookups and returns hits in a
reasonably useful format (at least as far as mutt's address-book hooks
go).  To use simply dump mutt_ldap_query.pl somewhere in your path, make
it executable, copy mutt_ldap_query.rc to $HOME/.mutt_ldap_query.rc and
change the two lines in it that you can probably guess you need to
change.  (Hint: search for WINDOWS_).

This thing started life as a perl script on the web by the same name,
was hacked by me to make it a little friendlier to use then hacked by
Jeff Honig to make it search a wider array of LDAP tables.

Example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ./mutt_ldap_query.pl macdonald
LDAP query: found 2
Joe.MacDonald@windriver.com	Joe MacDonald	()
Mary.MacDonald@windriver.com	Mary MacDonald	()
# ./mutt_ldap_query.pl mac
LDAP query: found 0
# ./mutt_ldap_query.pl "*mac*"
LDAP query: found 12

Hopefully that's fairly self-explanatory.
